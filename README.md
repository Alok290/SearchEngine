SearchEngine
Search Engine using DFA and DSA
Overview
This project implements a search engine using DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) for efficient string matching and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) to enhance search performance. The search engine is designed to provide fast and accurate search results by leveraging advanced algorithms and data structures.

Features
DFA-based String Matching: Utilizes a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to perform efficient string matching during searches, improving the speed of keyword searches.

Advanced Data Structures: Implements data structures like Trie, Hash Map, or any other relevant DSA to organize and manage search data effectively.

Search Relevance: Incorporates algorithms to rank and display search results based on their relevance to the query, enhancing the quality of user experience.

Keyword Highlighting: Highlights matched keywords in the search results to make it easy for users to identify relevant content.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

mysql connector
Apache Tomcat 9 version Link to Download
Usage
Launch the search engine application.

Enter your search query in the search bar.

The application will display relevant search results based on your query, highlighting the matched keywords.
